# Microsoft AZ-900 (Microsoft Azure Fundamentals) notes
This repository contains my personal "cheat sheet" for AZ-900 definitions. The exam heavily relies on knowing different Azure services and definitions, so I made my own "quick glance" file for studying.

I <b>HIGHLY RECOMMEND</b> checking out the extra resources below, <b>especially the Datawolf's PDF</b>. Microsoft's practice exam does not cover fully the real exam, the questions are much easier in the practice one. Datawolf's questions many times reflect and are 1:1 the real exam questions.

Please note that the AZ-900 certification can and most likely will alter in the future - these materials most likely will become obsolete over time. I still hope these notes offer some assistance - good luck with the exam!
